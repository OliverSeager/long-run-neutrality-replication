# long-run-neutrality-replication

This body of code is for the first draft of the paper currently titled "Is Money Neutral in the Long-Run? The Investment Channel Beyond Plant, Property and Equipment."

A lot of the code actually produces stuff that was left out of the paper or remained unfinished at the submission deadline. For example: 001c and 001d largely deal with calculating distance to default; 003a and 003b constitute a (at the moment pretty poor) attempt to produce a patent-gvkey mapping in the spirit of Arora, Belenzon, and Sheer (2017). 003c maps Kogan patent data to gvkeys.

002 is simply a replication of Ottonello and Winberry (2020) using my "exact calendar quarter" method of date-accounting in Compustat and contributes nothing to the paper.

To produce the results in the current version of the paper, all that's needed is 001a, 001b, 001c and 004.
