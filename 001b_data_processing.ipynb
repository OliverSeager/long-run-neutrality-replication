Let $\\Gamma_t$ to be a vector of Greenbook forecasts corresponding to meeting $t$, such that $\\Delta\\Gamma_t$ gives a vector of Greenbook forecast *revisions*. we take $u_t$ to be the *true* shock - that which cannot be explained by the beliefs the Fed currently has about real GDP growth, GDP Price Inflation and unemployment for the current and leading 2 quarters, conducting OLS regression as follows...\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s_t = \\alpha + \\mathbf{\\beta}\\cdot\\mathbf{\\Delta\\Gamma}_t + u_t.$$\n",

    "This would be a much more straightforward procedure if the Greenbook were compiled for all FOMC meetings. Typically, Greenbooks are only produced for scheduled meetings: for the 1990Q1-2009Q4 period, 160 of *all* 183 meetings saw novel Greenbooks published for FOMC members (that is, Greenbooks published since the previous meeting).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we are only able to attribute 160 of 183 1990Q1-2009Q4 meetings to a specific Greenbook. Since we study monetary shocks aggregated to a quarterly frequency, we use two distinct approaches here...\n",
    "- Firstly, we assume we cannot isolate the true shock for meetings with no Greenbook attached to them. We therefore exclude such meetings from the Miranda-Agrippino regression, and exclude these from our quarterly aggregation. We refer to the quarterly shocks that result from these as **formal Miranda-Agrippino shocks**.\n",
    "- Secondly, attribute Greenbook forecasts to the meetings that follow their publication, and where a meeting has no Greenbook forecasts we use linear interpolation (according to *meeting*, not Greenbook publication, dates). Only then do we calculate \"revisions\" since last meeting. We refer to the quarterly shocks that result from these as **full Miranda-Agrippino shocks**."
